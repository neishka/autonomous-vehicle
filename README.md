# ANoRC : AutoNomous RC-Car 

In this repository we would be sharing our demo code of our Capstone Project. The project is inspired by MIT RACECAR and is a working application of the course on [**UDACITY** : Self DRiving Car NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)
Firstly we would be applying **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**(Lane Detection, Streering angle movement prediction, etc.). 
Secondly, Use of [Sensor Fussion](https://towardsdatascience.com/sensor-fusion-90135614fde6) through which we will be filtering out the data from the array of sensors  for recognising the and analysing the environment. 

## How a self driving car works?

### Computer Vision
We use computer vision for thracking objects and finding lanes on roads.

### Deep Learning
